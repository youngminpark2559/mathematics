==================================================
All numbers can be represented by multiplication of prime numbers  

For example, 
$$$255=5\times 51$$$ 
$$$255=5\times (3\times 17)$$$ 

5, 3, 17 can't be divided further  
So, numbers which can't be divided further are "prime numbers"  

==================================================
Prime numbers don't look showing up regularly

For example, 
They show up quite in a row at some part
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:20:12.png"><xmp>

But they don't show up for a while at some part 
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:19:35.png"><xmp>

==================================================
Riemann hypothesis:
Non-trivial zero points of Zeta function will be on one line 

==================================================
Following equation 
which shows relationship between prime number and pi 
was created by Euler 

$$$\dfrac{2^2}{2^2-1} \times 
\dfrac{3^2}{3^2-1} \times 
\dfrac{5^2}{5^2-1} \times 
\dfrac{7^2}{7^2-1} \times 
\dfrac{11^2}{11^2-1} \times
... =\dfrac{\pi^2}{6}$$$

==================================================
Zeta function of Riemann 

$$$\zeta(x) = \prod\limits_p \dfrac{p^x}{p^x-1}
= \dfrac{2^x}{2^x-1} \times 
\dfrac{3^x}{3^x-1} \times 
\dfrac{5^x}{5^x-1} \times 
\dfrac{7^x}{7^x-1} \times 
\dfrac{11^x}{11^x-1} \times
...$$$

Graph of Zeta function

==================================================
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:42:11.png"><xmp>
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:43:44.png"><xmp>

Above shows location of point (called zero point) 
which has zero height in the graph 

==================================================
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:44:11.png"><xmp>

Where zero point will show?

==================================================
Riemann found 4 zero points 

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:45:33.png"><xmp>

And found zero points were on the one line like following 
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:46:06.png"><xmp>

==================================================
It's amazing because even if prime numbers show up in non-regular form, 
but zero points which are derived from zeta function 
and are more originally derived from prime numbers 
show up in regular form. 

==================================================
But since Riemann only found 4 zero points, 
he needed to think how about last all zero points? 
Would it be also on the one line like this? 
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:48:47.png"><xmp>

==================================================
Hypothesis of "Would it be also on the one line like this?"
is that non-trivial zero points of Zeta function will be on one line 

==================================================
If above hypothesis is proved,
it means that arrange of prime numbers has some regular rule 
in mathematical aspect 

==================================================
So, in conclusion, 
problem of finding rule in prime numbers 
is converted into problem of proving hypothesis 
saying all zero points are on the one line? 

==================================================
Hardy had proved that infinite zero points would be on the one line like this
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:59:14.png"><xmp>

But he didn't remove probability 
that zero points could existing outside of that line
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_10:59:52.png"><xmp>

==================================================
John Nash thought to prove Riemann hypothesis,
he could need unique way of accessing to hypothesis

==================================================
Dr. louis de branges says 
understanding prime numbers is related to dynamics in micro world 

==================================================
H. Montgomery found that 
unlike distribution of prime numbers 
which shows more irregular form of distribution 
zero points (in other words gap distance between each zero point) 
show more regular form of distribution 
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_11:18:39.png"><xmp>

==================================================
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/mathematics/master/others/pics/2019_02_06_11:22:25.png"><xmp>

Distribution of zero points has above notation 

==================================================
Above notation is similar to notation 
which represents gap of energy level of nucleus of atom like Uranium

Energy of nucleus of atom doesn't show in regular distribution
